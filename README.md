# hello-world
Hello Earthlings!
Spikk is here, i'm starting my work in the open source world, learning a lot of things, using a linux based pc, Arduino and electronics, programming etc. for making things better.
I hope, i can add some useful things here during my low speed learning process.
I think, my first topic will be making a home IoT frame system (secure MQTT broker inside my home network, connected to the web and some rules of thumb for ways of my later work) and then a bathroom vent regulator in this system turning on while inner humidity is higher then on the outside.

Best wishes!
